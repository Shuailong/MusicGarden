We were gathered by the sound
Listen close to what you found
Love will bring you by today
If it falls then hear what I say
This is life,life is love
If you love me
If you're lost outside the line
I will hold in tight
This is life,life is love
I have problems in my mind
Just illusions all the time
I remember you keep on moving
Better keep that fire burning inside
This is life,life is love
If you love me
If you're lost outside the line
I will hold in tight
This is life,life is love
Is it coming from your heart,coming from your heart?
Is it coming from your heart,coming from your heart?
Is it coming from your heart,coming from your heart?
Is it coming from your heart,coming from your heart?
This is life,life is love
If you love me
If you're lost outside the line
I will hold in tight
This is life,life is love
Is it coming from your heart,coming from your heart?
Is it coming from your heart,coming from your heart?
Is it coming from your heart,coming from your heart?
Is it coming from your heart,coming from your heart?
