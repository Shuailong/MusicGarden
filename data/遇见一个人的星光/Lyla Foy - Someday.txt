Someday, somepleace
I'll read for you too
Black dog, black dog
Ravened by the moon

(Chorus)
Memory don't fail me now
Raise a candle to that night
Let a restless head lie still
Give a shore to a hungry tide

Nearly kneeling
Newly darkened room
Breathing smoke rings all round you
Gathering silty swim
Dug out of the bay

Chorus
