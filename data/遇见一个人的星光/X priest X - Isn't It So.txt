You take California
Sold on chemistry
The sky is falling backward
It will break up slowly
Collect you in the city
Broke on Methedrine
Blinded by the ashes
You don’t see anything
Can’t say no
Can’t say yes
Isn’t it so
Isn’t it sad
CHORUS:
Go on and go
Closing time again
Can’t stay
Go on and go
The walls are closing in
You say
Electric situation
Bring the halcyon
Breaking heart and fever
You won’t hurt anyone
Can’t escape the sickness
Can’t escape a dream
Quickly going nowhere
Bowing to your queen
CHORUS:
Go on and go
Closing time again
Can’t stay
Go on and go
The walls are closing in
You say
Can’t say no
Can’t say yes
Isn’t it so
Isn’t it sad
