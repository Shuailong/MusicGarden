Wish we never left, 
Did we only just begun?
Holding in my heart, ever second now
It's time! Oh, oh, oh
Looking to the stars and asking for the sun
Wish we never left, 
Did we only just begun?
Airplanes flying to see your face
Something golden falls into place
Oh, oh, oh

We could go far somewhere and stay
Warm sun, ocean, time is broken

Chorus: 
Where would you sail away?
come sail away with me!
Where would you sail away?
come sail away with me!

Do you cry when you saw it happen?
I know I did, and I can't hide it
Real life, dreaming and now we're awake
Separate, so still nothing feels real

Chorus: (x3)
Where would you sail away?
come sail away with me!
Where would you sail away?
come sail away with me!

Wish I never left, 
Did it only just begun?
Holding in my heart, every second now
It's done!
Looking to the stars and asking for the sun
Wish we never left, 
Did we only just begun?
