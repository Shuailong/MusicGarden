In the prairie with the sheep
I fall to reap a wreath of bay berries
To crown the horses in your heart

I can't tame them for a thousand frozen days
They're wild as a storm, pulling the house down

Five feathers of a swan, to bind with Queen Anne's lace
And silver wheat, to crown the horses in your heart

I can't tame them for a thousand frozen days
They're wild as a storm, tearing the house down

I can't tame them for a thousand frozen days
They're wild as a storm

Oh, Amelia, Amelia fair, Starry eyed, (Amelia fair)
Ooo, Amelia, Amelia fair, Starry eyed, (Amelia fair)

Oo, Oh, Amelia, Wild as a storm....
