Erase it and erase me
It's a circular faith in living
Oh, there's more space 
Where your heart should be
Fill it with ends on lips
Kiss for feeling

Falling through insanity
You think I'm crazy
Love, it lingers
After death and into reality
Oh, a life lost is not my gain

You wanna LOVE GRACEFULLY 
Through your heart blissfully
Wanna DIE WITH DIGNITY
We can make it remember
Fight a little extra for me
And I'll break it open
Fight a little extra for me
And I'll break it open

Erase it and erase me
It's a circular faith in living
Oh, there's more space
Where your heart should be
Fill it with ends on lips
Kiss for feeling

You wanna LOVE GRACEFULLY 
Through your heart blissfully
Wanna DIE WITH DIGNITY 
We can make it remember
Fight a little extra for me
And I'll break it open
Fight a little extra for me
And I'll break it open

Love is not all you gave
At the end we all say it
Why did we fight and why did we pray
When the beginning was here anyway

You wanna LOVE GRACEFULLY
Through your heart blissfully
Wanna DIE WITH DIGNITY
We can make it remember
Fight a little extra for me
And I'll break it open
Fight a little extra for me
And I'll break it open
