Soft to the touch
Carrying on not the words to cut me
Don't you fall from your own, she says
And she blindfolds her eyes
Seek out, sink him
Breathe frost, yeah life is sin, now
Don't you fall from your own, she says
And the leaves are raw
Open that guilt cage 
I just wanna think free
Take the fear I've known forever
Reach out for the sky
Breathe and breed leaving me behind
I got some fuel to live and fail
With heads held down out on the rise
Thoughts are free and I'm going outside
To do some soul check and be
I'm going to hell
Open that guilt cage 
I just wanna think free
Take the fear I've known forever
Seek out, sink him
Breathe frost, yeah life is sin, now
I should fall from this song today
I should tie and top her mind
Stories be told, this is a life, open the curtains
Do you believe I'm going to hell?
