You've been around for the week-end
Been down on the rollerbend
Didn't wanna to give it up
We're in the same space, tightly
You've been around for the weekend
And made to look at each other's eyes
Under the rough of light he found me
There was a cool wind rolling around me
Under the rough of the night he found me
Only the rush of beauty cried
And now, for the whole time
Came out on a honeymoon given up on being down
We're in a pool of silence
Knocking me down for the whole time
He swam with a broken arm
Hadn't felt it coming on
We're falling, stuck in each others eyes
Under the rough of light he found me
There was a cool wind rolling around me
Under the rough of the night he found me
Only the rush of beauty cried
