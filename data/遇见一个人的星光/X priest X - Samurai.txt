And in the morning I wake up
Sunday morning glorious
Collect the pieces, pull it up
Call the sinners all hang out

Samurai, don't die
You are the only one
You are the only one
Samurai, don't die
You are the only one
You are the only one

Can we connect and live it out?
Same old tricks will work for now
Select our future and take off
Bring me back, I'm holding on

Samurai, don't die
You are the only one
You are the only one
Samurai, don't die
You are the only one
You are the only one

If life's a nuisance, burn it out
For me I'm just warming up
Why don't settle down and stay?
Afraid you'll just be tempting faith?

Samurai, don't die
You are the only one
You are the only one
Samurai, don't die
You are the only one
You are the only one
