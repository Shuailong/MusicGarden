In need of something to learn
Too much distance to know
In the crowded streets
Kissing of cheeks
Goodbye is a cry and we're calling it

I'm in a mood I occasionally feel
There's a rumour, don't wish it were real

(Chorus)
You left no barrier
No guard between us
Find me a flower
No need to reveal us

Take this ring from my finger
See how it mirrors the sky
And the wheels ran
Over your feet
No one could see from the window

Chorus

I lied and I wished it was over
Winter is coming to meet me
