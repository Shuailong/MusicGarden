You come to pass on my self, on my past
Ohhhh, oohhhh (Again)
Baby don’t worry
I’ll never let you down
When I find the evidence
Chalk it up to providence
Baby don’t worry
It’s all inside your head
Tell me what you wanna know
I will give you quite a show
Gonna take you away
Gonna take you away
When I take you down and they take you away
and I spin you around and I make you wait
and I turn you around
(repeat)
I go, you stay, we break
Tell me that’s ok
I go, you stay, we break
Tell me that’s ok
Baby don’t worry
The demons in your head
Always had the best intent
Ever try to listen in?
Baby don’t worry (Never ashamed)
I see it on your face (Worn on my face)
Banging up against the door (Looking through my door)
Hey I won’t let you come in through my door
Hey I won’t let you come in through my door
Come in through my door
Come in through my door
Hey I won’t let you come in through my door
Gonna take you away
Gonna take you away
When I take you down and they take you away
and I spin you around and I make you wait
and I turn you around
(repeat)
I go, you stay, we break
Tell me that’s ok
I go, you stay, we break
Tell me that’s ok
