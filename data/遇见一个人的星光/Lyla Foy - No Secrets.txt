When it begins to be spring
I hope we'll keep no secrets
To ourselves
I hung around for a year
You're worth two
Taken with no right to have you

(Chorus)
Am I allowed to love you yet
I've been an actor on a set
Rest your head down on my pillow
Tell me it's not over yet

I made a wish on a lash
Make a name for my own
Tender age
Put your picture in a frame
Made a list
Said your name to call you

Chorus

When it begins to be spring
I hope we'll keep no secrets to ourselves
I made a plan on my hand not too late
Whatever we are made to wait for

Chorus
