Baby I know you feel alone
Spend these days just wondering when you'd call
Baby, I want you for my own
Whispers calls to you after you hang up the phone
And I'd give you more,
Tell me that you want more and more
And I'd wait for you
Baby, if you want MY LOVE
And I'd take you on if I can't control myself
And I'd lay you down 
Baby if you want MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE
Baby if you want MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE
Baby if you want MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE
Baby if you want MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE


Baby please tell me you're alone
'Cause now I've got this running deep in my bones 
(my bones my bones my bones)
Baby please don't say no,
'Cause I need I need you to belong once more, oh
And I'd give you more,
Baby if you'd tell me so
And I'd wait for you
Baby, if you want MY LOVE
And I'd take you on if I can't control myself
And I'd lay you down 
Baby if you want MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE
Baby if you want MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE
Baby if you want MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE
Baby if you want MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE
