Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me my love

Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me my love

Over and above
Over and above
Over and above you go

Over and above
Over and above
Over and above you go
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
All the particles in slow motion
Like snow falling onto the ocean
Melting on the tip of your tongue
So just taste it

Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me my love

Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me my love

Over and above
Over and above
Over and above you go

Over and above
Over and above
Over and above you go

The west wind's blowing you sideways
Close your eyes for the crossfade
The signals in your mind
Take you further

Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me my love

Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me
Are you channeling me my love

Over and above
Over and above
Over and above you go

Over and above
Over and above
Over and above you go

Over and above
Over and above
Over and above you go

Over and above
Over and above
Over and above you go
