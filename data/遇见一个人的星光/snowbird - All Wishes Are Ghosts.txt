All wishes are ghost, wating dream above
May hight down like ...send the snow
And all I see in space they hicking they goes around
They mean but they didn't ...
We hold down inside
They know they run us onsode but we coming
I wish are ghost
Waiting ...like hight down ...in the snow
And they we stay in whisperin that happy...
I'm moving on and we hide down
Got all the .is inside but we get, we giving hard of this
When in the end is brake through since they felt from remeber
And carry remeber they day when they do their way...
Anybody will.since they
When in the end is brake through since...
Sometime you'll be by my side .
When in the end is brake through since they felt from remeber
And carry remeber they day when they do their way...
Anybody will.since they .and they are comign on all this time
Try to be by my side
And then when you .some of they say theit outside
And then whenyou're here and you ...and they say their outside
You lay home and say
Say that you fall asleep and some may say
You lay home ...just still here my darling
Just still here, still here
Still here, still here, still here
Still here, still here, still here
Just still here, still here, just still here
