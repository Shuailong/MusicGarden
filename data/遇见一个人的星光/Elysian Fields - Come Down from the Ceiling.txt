Hard to believe you and me
We were once thick as thieves
Just a bunch of wiseacres

And you mince in the dens
With the toasts of the moment

Where indulgence is all
But to whom took a fall
And you dread the contagion

The sun's gone down
You take your throne
Amongst the sycophants and fakers
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
Time to take the piss

To hold my place in your top favorites
Always on my best behavior

If you won't come down from the ceiling
If you won't come down from the ceiling

You're just a murmur inside the white void

Inside, inside, inside the white noise
Too high, too high, inside the white noise

If you won't come down from the ceiling
