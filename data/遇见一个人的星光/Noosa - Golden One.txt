I should've known it was never safe to go
Left upon me, I went over your soul
You left me crying, sailed the ocean wide
Yeah, you had the time of our lives
But you come hard, you come down hard
You come down, you come down hard
You say I'm the last one, the golden one
The only one to keep you safe
The last one, the golden one
THE ONLY ONE
You say I'm the last one, the golden one
The only one to keep you safe
The last one, the golden one
THE ONLY ONE
I'm the last one, the last one
You say that I'm the only one
The last one, the golden one
You say that I'm the only one
The last one, the last one
You say that I'm the only one
The last one, the golden one
The only one to keep you safe
Cross my heart, close my eyes
Follow you blind
Awake to find letters dressed
In a red of some kind
Remember when you left, we cried
Sailed the ocean wide
Yeah, we had the time of our lives
But you come hard, you come down hard
You come down, you come down hard
You say I'm the last one, the golden one
The only one to keep you safe
The last one, the golden one
THE ONLY ONE
You say I'm the last one, the golden one
The only one to keep you safe
The last one, the golden one
THE ONLY ONE
I'm the last one, the last one
You say that I'm the only one
The last one, the golden one
You say that I'm the only one
The last one, the last one
You say that I'm the only one
The last one, the golden one
The only one to keep you safe
We laughed, we cried, sailed the ocean wide
Yeah, we had the time of our lives
We laughed, we cried, sailed the ocean wide
Yeah, we had the time of our lives
